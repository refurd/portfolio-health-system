Subject: Small request: "New" label on the product page
Hi everyone,
A "nice to have" requirement came up: products uploaded in the last 30 days should have a small "NEW" badge on their image on both the listing page and the product detail page.
How big of a task would this be? Could we fit it into the current sprint if it's not a huge effort?
Thanks,
Anna
